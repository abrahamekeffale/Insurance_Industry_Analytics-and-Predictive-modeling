# Insurance Data Analysis and Modeling Project

## Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), A/B hypothesis testing, and statistical modeling of an insurance dataset. The goal is to extract insights about premium and claim trends, evaluate geographical and demographic differences, and build predictive models to help improve decision-making in the insurance industry.

## Key Features
- **Data Summarization**: Provides descriptive statistics, data structure review, and missing values assessment.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Univariate and multivariate analysis including histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- **A/B Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical tests (Chi-squared, t-tests) to evaluate key hypotheses such as risk and profit differences across various segments.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models for predicting Total Premium and Total Claims.
- **Model Interpretability**: Feature importance analysis using SHAP/LIME to understand which factors contribute most to predictions.
